# Wheelie's FFXI Fonts
Font replacements for Final Fantasy XI

## Installation

*Do you trust me?*  
  - [ ] **Yes, implicitly. You're a good person and I have no reason to doubt you.**  
     Great, jump into the `DAT` directory, find a setup you like and use the directory tree as a guide for replacing your `.DAT` with Wheelie's `.DAT`.

  - [ ] **Trust no one, not even yourself.**  
     This is the right answer, but you'll need to dig deeper. Check out [Caradog](https://github.com/caradog)'s [XI-View](https://github.com/caradog/xi-view) repository for information about how to swap fonts.  
     For those who already know the basics, you'll want to use the `DDS/` directory's contents like so:  
     
      **+** Main log fonts use `font moji`  
      **+** Character names and other basic UI elements use `font font`  
      **+** Menus use `menu menu2fon`
